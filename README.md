# 🔍 Insight-Gazer

**AI-powered product insight engine built with Gemini** — auto-detects key features, sentiment trends, and customer priorities from raw reviews.  
Insight-Gazer turns noisy user feedback into structured summaries so you can instantly understand what matters most to your customers.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Uses **Gemini AI** to analyze product reviews
- 📊 Automatically detects **key features** and their **positive/negative sentiments**
- ❤️ Highlights what customers **love** (and hate)
- 📁 Accepts **CSV upload** of raw reviews
- 🧠 Returns structured insights in JSON format
- 💻 Built with **React + TypeScript + Vite** for frontend and **Node.js (Vercel Function)** for backend

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads a CSV file of product reviews.
2. The app sends a cleaned subset to the Gemini API.
3. Gemini responds with structured insight — category, features, sentiments, highlights.
4. Insight-Gazer displays it in an interactive UI.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

In `.env` (not committed to GitHub), you must define:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here


On Vercel:
- Go to **Settings > Environment Variables** and set `GEMINI_API_KEY`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite
- **Backend**: Serverless Function via Vercel
- **AI**: Google Gemini (generative language model)

## 🧾 Example Prompt Sent to Gemini

```json
{
  "productName": "Electric Toothbrush",
  "reviews": [
    { "review_text": "Really cleans well, battery lasts long!" },
    { "review_text": "Too loud. But otherwise effective." }
  ]
}
```

## 📦 Setup (For Local Development)

⚠️ To test the backend locally, you'd need to replicate the serverless function using Express. In production, the backend is auto-deployed via Vercel.

### Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DheetchanyaMohan/Insight-Gazer.git
cd Insight-Gazer
```

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run dev server (frontend)
```
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
Gemini output may occasionally include malformed JSON (partially handled)

Rate-limited by Gemini API usage quota

Currently supports only English-language reviews
